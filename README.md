### Analyzing the following algorithms - Genetic Algorithm using Travelling Salesman Problem, Heap Sort, Tree Sort and Shell sort. 

#### NOTE: The scala codes have been done in the scala kernel of Jupyter Notebooks. To install Scala kernel, type the following command in your Anaconda Prompt

```
pip install spylon-kernel
python -m spylon_kernel install
```
In the sorting algorithms, we jotted down the execution time (In Milliseconds) for various N (No of elements) values and exported this data into respective csv files for analysis. The csv files with the (No of elements,Execution time) data for the three sorting algorithms are HeapSort_Analysis.csv, Shell_Sort_Analysis.csv, and TreeSort_Analysis.csv .

The excel-graph analysis of the best,average,worst time complexity and observed execution time for the sorting algorithms for different input sizes have also been provided.
